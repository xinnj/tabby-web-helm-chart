[Tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) doesn't host sync service anymore. In order to use the sync
function, a service named [tabby-web](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby-web) is needed to be hosted in 
a private cloud.   
Tabby-web repo only provides docker-compose script. So I create this helm chart for k8s deployment.
